    "In order to generalize the `strassen_matrix_mult` function to deal with square matrices of any dimension $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ and $B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ where m is not a power of two. We can calculate $\\hat n = 2^{\\left \\lceil{log_2(m)}\\right \\rceil }$ which is the smallest integer power of 2 greater than m. Further on we can instatiate two new square matrices $A_{aux},B_{aux} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\hat n \\times \\hat n}$ allocating in their top-left corner respectively the $A$ and $B$ matrix and filling all the remaning rows and columns with 0. Thus we can call the original function `strassen_matrix_mult` on those two new matrices $A_{aux}$ and $B_{aux}$ obtaining as a result a matrix $C_{aux} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\hat n \\times \\hat n}$ which has in his top-left corner a matrix $C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times m}$ and all the other rows and columns filled with zeros. Eventually, we simply have to extract the submatrix $C$ from $C_{aux}$ and there we have our result.\n",
    "This technique require many allocation, nevertheless we can show that the asymptotic complexity does not change.

    "In order to reduce the number of auxiliary matrices firstable we can avoid to allocate all the matrices $S$ which contains the sum of the submatrices and directly perform the summation on the recursive call. Moreover we can allocate all the matrices $P_i$ in the same space, indeed we can use them once at a time; in order to do this I modified the function `assign_submatrix` to take an extra parameter, for which, if it is true, the submatrix will be added. In this way the total number of auxiliary matrices used will be 9. I have also implemented another version where I get rid of the allocation of the submatrices $A_{i,j}$ and $B_{i,j}$, my aspectation was that the time saved avoiding the allocation of the submatrices would be exceeded or at least compensated by the additional computational time deriving from extracting many time the same submatrices.\n",
    "Below are the measurment that I took, my expectation has partially been confirmed, infact the second version perform very similar to the first one (sometimes better sometime worse), however they both performed aroud a $5\\%$ better than the original version which I think it's a good result."
